          have experience using some programming languages such as JavaScript
          and Python, in collaboration with HTML and CSS to build amazing and
          complex web sites; involving beautiful interfaces, client side logic
          (front-end), and server side logic (back-end). I have knowledge in
          Computer Science, Responsive Web Design, Object Oriented Programming,
          APIs and Microservices, Database Management, graphic design, video
          editing, among others. For the projects in which I was involved, I've
